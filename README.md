# ToDo Cal

# # Overview
ToDo Cal helps users stay accountable by giving them an option to schedule a time to complete
them. When the user has a task listed and confirms their intended time to finish it, ToDo Scheduler 
will schedule the earliest time in the coming week that fits their time range on their Google Calendar.
